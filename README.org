seriestracker helps you keep track of the tv shows you watch and always know when new releases get out.

It makes use of the API provided by [[https://www.episodate.com][Episodate]]. Many thanks to them!

* Install

The package is on MELPA, but you can still install the development version by cloning this repo and specifying the ~:load-path~ in ~use-package~.

#+begin_src elisp
(use-package seriestracker
  :load-path "/path/to/seriestracker")
#+end_src

* Configure

#+begin_src elisp
(use-package seriestracker
  :demand                                                   ;;To force loading seriestracker
  :config                                                   ;;These are the default
  (setq seriestracker-file (concat user-emacs-directory "seriestracker.el")
        seriestracker--fold-cycle 'seriestracker-all-folded ;; can also be 'seriestracker-all-unfolded or 'seriestracker-series-folded. Will deternine the folding at startup
        seriestracker-show-watched "hide"                   ;; whether to hide or "show" the watched episodes
        seriestracker-sorting-type "next"))                 ;; or "alpha" for alphabetic sort
#+end_src>

* Usage

Run ~seriestracker~ to start *seriestracker*.

Press ~A~ to search for a series and add it to the tracker.

The controls are outline-like :
- ~p/n~ to move by line
- ~C-p/n~ to move by header
- ~C-u~ to go up a level
- ~C-b/f~ to move by header of the same level
- ~C-d/e~ to un/fold
- ~TAB~ to cycle visibility


Press ~w~ to watch the episode/season/series under point, or a visual selection. You can also press ~u~ to watch all episodes up to the one under point.  
Press ~W~ to toggle displaying episodes that have already been watched.  
Press ~N~ to add/remove a note on the episode or series title under point. Notes are displayed in the minibuffer on mouse or text cursor hover.

You can also access a transient popup /Ã  la/ magit by pressing ~h~.  
In addition to being a cheatsheet, it allows you to manually save/load, as well as set the savefile.
You can also set the sorting strategy there (alphabetically or by next episode to watch).

Although you can manually update the database by pressing ~U~, running ~seriestracker~ updates on startup.  
Quitting with ~q~ autosaves to ~seriestracker-file~.
